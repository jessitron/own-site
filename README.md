# Jess makes a web site

This is my attempt to create my own web site from the top down. Not because that's the best way 
to do it, but because I want to learn CSS principles.

[This site on GitHub Pages](https://jessitron.github.io/own-site)

# Plan

- make it prettier
- add some content
- play around
- repeat

# Development

It is a static site. Whatever local http server will work. Here is what I did:

`npm i -g http-server`

`http-server`

Then visit: [http://localhost:8080]()

boom.
